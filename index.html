<section><p>
In programming fdjfjaslkjfka   with an emphasis strong type systems, such as
Rust or Haskell, there exists a technique called type-level
programming. I think TLP is an interesting solution for some class of
problems, so I am sharing a very brief introduction to the concepts
involved.
</p>

<p>
If one hangs out in the right circles, you might have heard of
dependent types, such as in <a href="https://www.idris-lang.org/">Idris</a>. The Wikipedia definition of
dependent types is "a type whose definition depends on a value." This
can be useful, if we want to align our types with real-world
constraints.
</p>

<p>
While I have written my fair share of Haskell, I first explicitly came
across TLP in embedded Rust, specifically in the <a href="https://docs.rs/embedded-hal/latest/embedded_hal">embedded-hal</a> crate,
which uses types to distinguish hardware pin modes. I am going to
adapt this example to showcase the benefits.
</p>
</section>

<section><h2>Shifting Left</h2>
<p>
But first, a bit of theory. In regular programming, a type is a set of
values, so a <code>u8</code> is integers between zero and 255. With static
typing, we can know the type of a value at any time without having to
run the program.<label for="1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
I'd say "at compile time," but one can totally have static
types without a compilation step. <code>cargo check</code> is kind of that, it
will type check, but not compile. LSP will also tell you the type of a
variable for many languages, such as Typescript.
</span> This is considered useful because it prevents a
class of errors from happening at program run time, where they could
cause harm, the idea being that you would rather have the compiler
complain than the program crash and kill people.
</p>

<p>
Now sometimes it might be useful to know not just the type, i.e. the
set of possible values, but also the specific value of a variable
prior to running the program, also to prevent bugs. Languages such as
Rust and Haskell not only have types as sets of values, but also sets
of types, which are called traits and type classes respectively.<label for="2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
Typescript's union types are actually an example as well.
</span> I
will use the term traits here for brevity. Traits can also be
determined prior to running a program, and can act in the same way as
types to say "this is an element of this set," but the set is now a
set of types, not a set of values.
</p>

<p>
Because types are also known at the same time, by "shifting left" our
values to be types, and our types to be traits, we have gained
complete knowledge of our program without running it. If we know the
"value" of a variable prior to running the program, we have actually
computed the variable ahead of time.<label for="3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="3" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
The same would be true if we hard-coded a constant. We know the
variable has a known value, so we can avoid any bugs related to it
having the wrong value.
</span>
</p>
</section>

<section><h2>Embedded Systems</h2>
<p>
Coming back to embedded-hal, I mentioned pin modes. One of the
important factors in embedded development is that one has limited
access to the environment a program runs in, which makes debugging
more cumbersome, and errors can often be irrecoverable.<label for="4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="4" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
Not to mention fatal, in the case of many micro-controllers in
charge of hardware that can potentially kill.
</span> This
explains why some additional steps are taken to improve program
correctness, even at the cost of ergonomics in some cases.
</p>

<p>
In the case of many micro-controllers, such as any of the popular
Arduino family, one has to declare <a href="https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/microcontrollers/digital-pins">the mode</a> of a GPIO pin, usually one
of several different flavours of in- or output. This changes the
behaviour of the pin on an electrical level, and is important to get
right to get the right behaviour, and avoid releasing the magic
smoke.<label for="5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="5" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
The one you see if you fry one of your components.
</span>
</p>

<p>
The <a href="https://reference.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/digital-io/pinmode/">standard code</a> for this in the Arduino variant of C++ is:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span class="org-type">void</span> <span class="org-function-name">setup</span>() {
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);    <span class="org-comment-delimiter">// </span><span class="org-comment">sets the digital pin 13 as output</span>
}

<span class="org-type">void</span> <span class="org-function-name">loop</span>() {
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH); <span class="org-comment-delimiter">// </span><span class="org-comment">sets the digital pin 13 on</span>
  delay(1000);            <span class="org-comment-delimiter">// </span><span class="org-comment">waits for a second</span>
  digitalWrite(13, LOW);  <span class="org-comment-delimiter">// </span><span class="org-comment">sets the digital pin 13 off</span>
  delay(1000);            <span class="org-comment-delimiter">// </span><span class="org-comment">waits for a second</span>
}
</code></pre>

<p>
This looks fine, but what happens if you do not get the pin mode
right, for any of many possible reasons? <code>digitalWrite</code> still does
<a href="https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/digital-io/digitalwrite/">something</a>, but not what you want it to do. This could be a difficult
to track down bug.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal/blob/main/examples/arduino-uno/src/bin/uno-blink.rs">In Rust</a> on the other hand&#x2026;
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span class="org-keyword">let</span> <span class="org-keyword">mut</span> <span class="org-variable-name">led</span> = pins.d13.into_input();

<span class="org-keyword">loop</span> {
    led.set_high();
    <span class="org-constant">arduino_hal</span>::delay_ms(1_000);
    led.set_low();
    <span class="org-constant">arduino_hal</span>::delay_ms(1_000);
}
</code></pre>

<p>
&#x2026; this bug becomes a compile-time error:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code>LL  |     led.set_high();
    |         ^^^^^^^^ method cannot be called on `Pin&lt;Input&lt;Floating&gt;, PB5&gt;` due to unsatisfied trait bounds
[...]
LL  | pub struct Pin&lt;M, I&gt;
    | --------------------
    | |
    | doesn't satisfy `_: _embedded_hal_digital_OutputPin`
</code></pre>

<p>
The key here is the first line, specifically the <code>.into_output()</code>
call. This method consumes the pin, which has a type of
<code>Pin&lt;Input&lt;Floating&gt;, PB5&gt;</code>,<label for="6" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="6" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
There is a lot going on here, this pin actually has a type that
contains not only the mode of the pin, but also the specific pin
number. This means pin identity is fixed on a type level, and such at
compile time.
</span> and returns a new pin of a
different type <code>Pin&lt;Output, PB5&gt;</code>. Only this type implements the
<code>OutputPin</code> trait, and thus actually has the <code>.set_high()</code> and
<code>set_low()</code> methods defined for it. This allows one to write a
function that takes for example any pin in the floating input mode, or
just a specific pin in a specific mode.
</p>

<p>
An added benefit here is that no run time checking is required, which
saves valuable CPU cycles, as well as no error handling or recovery
code, which would be more work and hold the potential for more bugs.
